		Instructions:
		
		Follow along with the sequence below if you'd like to add/remove lines to the 
		NEW/UPDATED PATIENT ACCOUNT email that goes out whenever a new MHT 
		patient account is created.
		
		Whenever you would like to add a line of text, start a new line, enter:
		
		copy += '';
		
		...and fill in your copy between the two '' markers.
		
		If you'd like to start a new line, enter:
		
		copy += newLine;
		
		If youâ€™d like to start a new paragraph, enter:
		
		copy += newParagraph;
		
		Just to be safe, it's a good idea to make a duplicate/back-up copy of this original 
		file just in case something goes wrong and you need to revert back. Always keep 
		a back-up copy of this file.
